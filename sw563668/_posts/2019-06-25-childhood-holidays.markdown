My mother was a ‘stay at home’ mother until I started secondary school. Dad worked for the Shell Company full time. They always managed to get annual leave during school holidays, usually the Christmas holidays, and we would go away as a family.

The first knowledge I have about a holiday was when I was 6 months old. In later years when there was a heat wave, mum would often say it was not as hot as the year we went on a beach holiday. She would relate that I was in a basket under the trees at the beach and it was so hot I was as slippery as a pig, in just a nappy, so that it was difficult to pick me up.

Mum and Dad would rent a caravan or a house (sometimes with family or friends) and sometimes we would stay with family. Most years we would holiday at a beach. Sometimes we would travel in the September holidays and visit scenic areas. As we grew older, the holidays could be further from home.

I remember going to Mallacoota to a rented house for Christmas. There was a goanna in a tree in the backyard, we found a trapdoor spider in the garden, the tap water we drank had wrigglers (mosquito larvae) in it, it rained on Christmas day and the roof leaked during our dinner, but we had a great time.

There was no TV viewing during our holidays, most of every day would be spent outside, mum packed salad sandwiches and cordial for lunch if we were going to be out and about. Afternoons and evenings were spent playing games (Monopoly, Squatter) and cards (rush patience, canasta, rummy, five hundred).

I remember swimming at Narooma (NSW), it was the coldest water I had ever been in, and I was stung by a jelly-fish, OUCH. 

Tidal River was a favourite after Peg (mum’s sister) and Allan moved there when Allan became head ranger. We spent a lot of time swimming off the rocks in the river, and in the evenings we would sit on the lounge room floor counting and bank bagging the gate takings. After Peg and Allan bought the café business in Tidal River Janet, Mary and I (Heather was too young) would work in the café while holidaying, we also took the train down on our own to work over Easter once or twice.

When we were travelling, Dad liked to explore. If he saw a dirt side road, he would turn down it saying he wanted to see where it went, amid very noisy groans from the back and middle front seats. One holiday we pulled a caravan to Wilpena Pound (SA). It had been raining and we were travelling down a red dirt road when the car skidded a bit and ended up in the mounds of dirt piled along the edges of the road. And yes, it was the kids who had to get out and push the car while Dad was steering. No, we didn’t get too upset, it was just another adventure to laugh about afterwards.

When we were older, mum and dad took long service leave during the September holidays and we travelled to the Sunshine Coast to stay with Great Aunt Ivy (mum’s aunt). We had a great time, we were not far from the beach, going swimming often even though it was not very hot. From there mum and dad went on driving further north for their long holiday, while we four girls caught the train back to Melbourne and school and a fairly strict Aunty Mary (dad’s sister).

On another holiday after Janet was married, we caught the ferry to Tasmania. Mum and Dad, Mary and Bob (her boyfriend ? fiancée), Heather and me. We towed a caravan round most of the state. This was in January but when we climbed Mt Wellington, it was snowing on top. After we left one of the camping grounds, there was a bit of noise out the back of the car, the caravan had come off the tow bar and slid into the small bank at the side of the road. Yes, another adventure getting the caravan reattached.
