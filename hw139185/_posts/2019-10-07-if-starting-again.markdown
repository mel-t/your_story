I was one of those people for whom the question of ‘What will I do when I grow up?’ became an ongoing question most of my adult life! In other words, I was on some sort of quest to find my ‘niche’.
 
Although the career roles I have had have been those of the ‘traditional female’ roles in the ‘caring’ professions, I have been very lucky that there have been opportunities to work broadly across a number of areas and to have acquired a range of skills. For example, working in health promotion, including devising marketing strategies and organising events.
 
I have always liked roles that involved direct contact with people and I suppose roles where I thought I could make a difference. Community development was an area that required the use of a broad range of skills including those I just mentioned, plus research and report writing. I also had to work with small, community based advisory groups and boards and this could be challenging. I found myself trying to ‘educate’ some of these people and persuade them to broaden their vision and see new possibilities.
 
I found many aspects of my later teaching roles in tertiary education interesting and rewarding. I think any role that involves ongoing learning and acquiring new skills is rewarding.
 
Perhaps if there was anything more I was to do career wise it would be to do more in the field of social research. I enjoy investigating and uncovering new information. I love interviewing people, learning about their lives, their passions and telling their stories. I find the field of epi-genetics fascinating and the social determinants of health is an area we need to do more work in. However, I think for someone of my age, growing up at a time and place where the opportunities for girls were limited, I have managed to move sideways and ‘reinvent’ myself several times.
 
If I was younger and fitter I could perhaps be tempted to do some voluntary work for an International NGO but for now I will concentrate my energies on being a grandmother!
