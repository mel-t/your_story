The problem with this question is that any ‘advice’ that I could give in regard to careers and jobs could be very out of date by the time you are thinking about this sort of thing!

When I was a child it was common for adults to ask, ‘What do you want to be when you grow up?’ A rather silly question as you don’t always know what the possibilities will be and you probably haven’t discovered your areas of interest. As I have mentioned before, in my day there were few choices for girls, mainly teaching or nursing.

But, it is a very different world now, there are definitely more options and more fields opening up all the time. I do think it is important to choose something that you find rewarding, something that challenges you to extend yourself, but also something that you find interesting and enjoyable.

It is now quite common to have more than one job in your working life and it is often possible to transition to another field where you can utilise your skills and previous learning in a new way. Ongoing learning is crucial wherever we are working. I think it is important to be open to change, to be flexible, to keep your options open and to broaden your skills.

The same sorts of things that are important for succeeding in school, at sport or in learning an instrument are important in working life too. So, having managed those things you are well prepared. Part time jobs while you are still at school can also be helpful to give you confidence and prepare for your future working life.

In summary, your ideal job should be one that utilises your skills and one that you find fulfilling and rewarding. Sometimes, there may be compromises along the way but it is my wish that you do find your ‘ideal’ job, the one that suits you.
