I haven’t had big celebrations for my birthdays. When I was a child, birthdays were celebrated within the family. My birthday was three days after my father’s birthday and we often shared a cake. My mother always baked a fruit cake for birthdays which was iced in a traditional way with a layer of marzipan, then a thick sugar paste icing. The Christmas cake was made the same way but did not have the birthday candles of course!

As an adult my birthdays have not been large affairs, maybe dinner with a few friends and the mandatory cake with the family. Of course a special birthday was my 35th birthday which was the year we lived in California because Mark was born just one week before my birthday. 
 
My friend, Elizabeth Fitzgerald, and I discovered when we first met in Shepparton more than thirty years ago, that we were born in the same year and only one day apart so we usually try to catch up and go out around the time of our birthdays.

A birthday I remember was one year we spent with friends who lived on a bush block in Rushworth. It was a casual, outdoor celebration. We had a campfire and toasted marshmallows. Stephanie and Dennis had conjured up a special cake from the Women’s Weekly Birthday Book (this was the book I always used for birthday cakes) and somehow I hadn’t seen it being made so it was a lovely surprise.
 
When Simon, Stephanie and Mark’s cousin, Bernie, came to live with us in Shepparton we ended up with three birthdays in the one week! The Women’s Weekly Birthday Cake Book was much used that week. Mark’s birthday was first and he often had a soccer themed cake, then Bernie’s and finally mine. Everyone had had enough cake by the time it got to my birthday!

I spent my 50th birthday in Islamabad just before Stephanie, Mark and I returned to Australia from a year in Pakistan. It was incredibly hot, well over 40 degrees and as I don’t like hot weather it was not very pleasant. When we got back to Australia, Simon, who was at Melbourne Uni at this time, organised a surprise welcome home/birthday gathering at the house of some friends. I had no idea, it was a total surprise. I think I was somewhat shell shocked and a bit ‘dislocated’ as it was very strange returning to Shepparton after Pakistan. I think there was a kind of ‘reverse culture shock’. It was also winter here so an extreme difference in temperature.
 
More recently we had a lovely family weekend away to celebrate my 70th birthday and Mark’s 35th birthday. Since then we have added two more family members, Anya, born later that year and Alex, two years later. The following year we spent at Marysville since my birthday usually falls around the time of the Queen’s Birthday long weekend. It is a good time to go away and it is good to have these family gatherings but we are getting to be too big a family to stay in one place. We did manage a family weekend in Rye shortly after Mark and Jess bought the house there.

I’ve noticed that young children and very elderly people like to boast about their age, ‘I’m five’ or ‘I’m nearly ninety’ and these ages seem to be celebrated more, although in recent times ‘decade’ birthdays are more frequently celebrated too. Eighteenth birthdays have also become more significant than they were when I was young. This seems appropriate since it is a time of transition and significant changes in a young person’s life.
 
Birthdays are important as they provide an opportunity to get together with family and friends and I suppose too, an opportunity to take stock and appreciate one’s good fortune.
