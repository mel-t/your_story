I met Dennis in 1971 through family friends. I had only recently moved to Melbourne and was working as a District Nurse based at the Heidelberg centre.

I made contact with Lesley and Mil Mears whom I had met once before when I came to Melbourne, at about 14, to visit a school friend who had moved here from Hobart. My parents had met Lesley and Mil during the war when my father and Mil were serving in the Airforce. My mother and Lesley were both in hospital having their first babies at the same time. I was one of those babies and their son, Geoff, was the other one.

In 1971 Lesley and Mil lived in Heathmont and Dennis was living with them. Dennis had been briefly married to Lesley and Mil’s only daughter Margaret who was tragically killed at 19 years of age in a car accident a few months after their wedding.

I think it was the second time I met Dennis that I was invited to a family gathering at a restaurant in the Dandenongs. It was late autumn and I remember I was wearing brick red culottes, a black skivvy and boots. Lesley asked Dennis to pick me up as I didn’t know my way around Melbourne and there was no GPS in those days!

At the restaurant I somehow managed to get myself locked in the toilet and they had to pass me a screwdriver so I could get out. Dennis later told me he decided that I needed someone to look after me! He also told me that for him, it was ‘love at first sight’ and that is why the Roberta Flak song, ‘The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face’ is a special song for me.
