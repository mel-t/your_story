When I was a child we didn’t have television so news came via news bulletins on the radio or in the newspaper. The radio news would have been on but I think I probably ‘tuned out’ as it was not very interesting or meaningful for me.

I think television, especially colour television, has a very powerful impact today. News stories are often accompanied by graphic images of disasters or violence and it can be difficult to shield children from this. Therefore I think children today are more aware of major news. We generally seem to know a lot more about what is going on in the world today through the variety of media sources we now have.

Maybe the first major news item I was aware of and understood was the coronation of the young Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. There were a lot of photographs in the newspaper and in magazines and radio commentary. I guess I found this interesting and it was only a year later that the Queen visited Australia which was exciting. Local school children in Hobart lined up around the edge of the North Hobart football ground oval. We were waving flags while the Queen drove around the oval. This was the first time a reigning British monarch had visited Australia and the tour was the biggest event ever organised in Australia and a source of great interest throughout the country.

Other events were taking place in the early 1950s but I was only dimly aware of them. They were far away and did not seem relevant to me in Hobart. For example, the diary of Anne Frank was published (it was some time later that I read it), the United States was testing a hydrogen bomb in the Pacific, Nelson Mandela was arrested in South Africa and in London the smog was so bad that many people died. In Kenya there was a demand for independence from Britain and the Mau Mau Uprising. Apparently the movie ‘Singing in the Rain’ was released at this time and I would have first heard the song at that time on the radio.

One development I was aware of and which did impact on me was the development of the Salk vaccine for the prevention of polio. Polio was an awful scourge at this time and many children were infected by the virus and left permanently paralysed so this was a very important scientific advance. I was quite aware of this and when I was able to receive this vaccination in my early school years it was reassuring to know that it meant I would not contract polio. It was replaced 10 years later by the Sabin oral vaccine so no more injections!

Due to widespread vaccination programs with the oral vaccine polio has now been eradicated although there were pockets of it in remote areas for a long time and I did see children who had been affected when we lived in Pakistan in the mid 1990s. These children had come to St Joseph’s Hospice in Rawalpindi (near Islamabad) to be fitted with braces. Without these braces they could not walk. I visited St Joseph’s weekly with a friend to provide some activities for these children and Stephanie came too once or twice.
