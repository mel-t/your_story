I can’t recall any major items of extravagance. As I was never earning a large salary I couldn’t be too extravagant.
 
When I was young our pay came as cash in an envelope and there weren’t such things as credit cards, paying bills online or online shopping. Cheque books were used to pay bills. You wrote a cheque and posted it in the mail. It was probably good not to have credit cards as it meant you couldn’t spend money you didn’t have! However, there was ‘lay by’ which was when the shop kept the item and you gradually paid it off each pay day.
 
I always liked nice clothes and shoes so that was probably where I spent money although I was often able to get these on sale. As you know, I have a fairly small foot and shoe shops would use my sized shoe for display. At the end of the season these had not sold so they were heavily reduced. Unfortunately it seems feet are bigger these days and now they rarely stock my size.
 
Some time before I was married I acquired a taste for perfume. I think the first one was Nina Ricci’s ‘L’air du Temps’. I probably liked the name as much as the smell and it came in a beautiful bottle. Actually you can still get it. For many years I loved a Shiseido perfume called ‘Zen’. I would still buy it today if I could but unfortunately they stopped making it.
 
In the past I would feel a bit guilty about anything that seemed ‘extravagant’ but less so these days. I guess most of my ‘extravagances’ or indulgences are on a small scale such as buying flowers for the house every week! Having flowers around seems to lift my mood.
