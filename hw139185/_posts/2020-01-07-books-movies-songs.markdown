I enjoy reading, I do like a good movie and of course I also like singing but as far as poetry goes my tastes are probably not very broad nor sophisticated. I do like Shakespeare’s sonnets, the poetry of Wordsworth and Keats, Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s ‘Rime of the Ancient Mariner’, and T.S. Eliot, particularly ‘Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats’. Probably the first poetry I encountered and which I still love was that in ‘The Magic Pudding’, a classic Australian children’s book written and wonderfully illustrated by Norman Lindsay in 1918. Why do I like it? Perhaps because it is clever, funny and a bit irreverent.
 
So how do I choose ‘a favourite’ from all the books I have read? I don’t think I can! The best book I read last year was ‘A Gentleman in Moscow’ by Amor Towles. I believe there is a film version being made. It is written by an American but set in Moscow. It is clever, well written, informative, amusing and provides an overview of Russia at a time of major change. 
 
I have just finished reading a book set in Hobart and Antarctica. It was written by a young Australian author, Favel Parrett; the title is ‘When the Night Comes’. Again it was well written, and again, although a novel, it is based on fact. It was particularly pertinent to me because it described so much of Hobart and the story was based around a Danish ship called the Nella Dan which for more than 20 years transported scientists from Hobart to the Australian Antarctic bases. I remember seeing it docked in Hobart in the 1960s. I am now reading and enjoying a book written by Kazuo Ishiguro. It is called ‘When we were Orphans’.
 
I suppose over the years I have read and enjoyed many books. Reading was my main diversion as a child. Favourite books are ones that take me to another time and place, expand my horizons, show me how people lived at a different time in history, teach me something about humanity and perhaps move me in some way. I think of Charles Dickens, of Alexander Solzhenitsyn or more recently the author Markus Zusak who wrote ‘The Book Thief’ or ‘The Kite Runner’ written by Khaled Hosseini. 
 
But also when going through some difficult times I found comfort in the books written by the Scottish author, Alexander McCall Smith - ‘The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency’ series set in Botswana and featuring the most engaging and wise character, Mma Precious Ramotswe. These books take one back to a simpler time and place, they offer a ‘quiet escape’ from today’s reality, and they are uplifting and hopeful. 
 
I am not good at remembering movies that I have enjoyed and  I have seen quite a few in 2019! Last night I watched a good adaptation of ‘Little Women’ from the 1990s on TV and I know a new film version has just been released in cinemas which I will try to see. Some classics never go out of fashion and every few decades a new version is released, perhaps with a fresh take on the story. Probably a lot of the films I like are historical and based on novels or plays (for example Shakespeare’s plays) or foreign language films. I suppose the films I like are usually classed as ‘Art House’ films rather than ‘Blockbusters’.
 
One film I saw not long ago was ‘The Farewell’, about a Chinese family and the relationship between a grandparent and her granddaughter. I also saw a film about Pavarotti’s life which was full of wonderful singing, and ‘Judy’ which starred Renee Zellweger and was about the life of Judy Garland (from ‘The Wizard of Oz’ - that is a favourite film of mine!). 
 
My favourite song is impossible to say as my taste ranges from ‘Fly Me to the Moon’ and ‘Over the Rainbow’ to  ‘Nessun Dorma’ from the opera Turandot and the hauntingly beautiful ‘Pie Jesu’ written by Andrew Lloyd Webber. Some songs are good for singing along to, others for simply ‘feeling’. It probably depends on my mood.
 
I think music is a vehicle for our emotions and it seems so many of my favourites are arias or duets from operas because they are so passionate. I am thinking of Verdi, Puccini and Bizet. There is an exquisite aria written by Saint-Saëns for the opera ‘Samson et Dalila’, ‘Mon coeur s’ouvre à ta voix’ which I love.
 
When I was young I liked many of the hit songs of the time which included hit songs by Buddy Holly, Bill Hayley, Neil Sedaka and Bobby Darrin. Elvis Presley, Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra were all popular singers at this time too but as we moved into the 1960s there was Dusty Springfield, the Beach Boys, folk music and protest songs with The Mamas and the Papas, Simon and Garfunkel and Bob Dylan, and of course the great sensation of the times, The Beatles. It was an exciting time of great change with new music genres emerging.
 
I do like some of the African American Spiritual songs (e.g. ‘Swing low, sweet chariot’), Edith Piaf (‘La vie en rose’), the songs of Cole Porter (e.g. ‘You’re the tops’),  Franz Lehár’s music (e.g. ‘Dein ist mein ganzes herz’) and the jazz era songs of the 1920s. I also like Gershwin’s music (e.g. ‘Porgy and Bess’), Ella Fitzgerald, particularly her duets with Louis Armstrong, and the soundtrack of ‘Sleepless in Seattle’. I simply can’t pick a favourite from that lot!
 
I am conscious of the fact that whoever is reading this will most likely not be familiar with the majority of what I have listed above. So, in summary, I like mainly like music that moves me and particular favourites include ‘Ave Maria’ (Franz Bieber and Giulio Caccini’s versions), ‘Panis Angelicus’ (César Franck) sung by the choir of King’s College, Cambridge and ‘Deep Peace’ by Bill Douglas.
 
Finally a piece of music I love is Méditation from Thäis by Jules Massenet and a special piece of music for me also is the Adagio from Mozart’s Clarinet Concerto that Simon played at his Scotch College concert.
