Luckily I did not have rigid expectations about how life would be or ‘should be’ and perhaps that helped me deal with the inevitable twists and turns that do occur in life.
 
Many things that have happened have not been things I imagined would happen. Whilst I did not expect to stay in Hobart all my life I really didn’t anticipate living in Shepparton and even when we did move there, I did not imagine I would be there for more than 30 years. I did not expect to have a baby born in California, to live for a time in Cambodia nor to spend a year in Pakistan living in a separate location to my husband.
 
I also didn’t expect to have quite so many problems with my body at an age when many people are still relatively fit and healthy. However, on the positive side, I have had many experiences that I would not necessarily have expected to have. Some of these were the opportunities to travel and experience other cultures, the variety of job roles I had whilst living in Shepparton from work with migrant groups to tertiary teaching and also voluntary work experiences such as having a weekly program on the local Community Radio Station.
 
However, there is one very major way in which life took a totally unexpected turn and that was Dennis’s brain injury. In his early 60s Dennis was fit and healthy. He did not have any of the health problems associated with many men of his age such as high blood pressure, being overweight, having cardiac disease or diabetes. Dennis had been working on Agricultural Development projects in several overseas countries and was just about to start a new project in Cambodia. His ‘accident’ was sudden, unexpected and totally devastating. Life as it had been was to be no more. Not only was Dennis’s brain affected by lack of oxygen which meant he could not work any more, but he also had other debilitating physical problems resulting from the emergency surgery carried out in Horsham. These issues resulted in a very poor quality of life for almost a decade. Efforts to get any effective help for Dennis were fruitless and his despair was very painful to witness. Not being able to relieve his prolonged suffering was the most challenging experience of my life. 
 
When Dennis died I was considered to be relatively young to be widowed and certainly none of my friends in Shepparton were widowed. This was something I had not expected, to be on my own at that age. Although I did choose to move into this house in Stewart St, again it was not something I had expected I would do. It is however proving convenient for the moment and it is good to be fairly close to all the family.
 
Whilst I do regret what happened to Dennis, I do not regret the other unexpected turns my life has taken. They have provided me with opportunities to grow as a person.
