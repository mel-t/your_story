Wow, what a question! It raises all sorts of other interesting questions such as, ‘How well do we really know ourselves?’.  It is, I think true, that we don’t see ourselves as others see us nor do we ever really know what others think of us and really who’s to say what is ‘right’ or ‘wrong’? I suspect, for example, if you asked a dozen people who know me you might get a dozen different answers about how they see me.
 
The reason for this is probably that behaviour can vary depending on the context; time and place, the occasion and even who we are with. Well, I think that is the case with me anyway. I find I feel more engaged or upbeat with certain people and I think my manner depends on the ‘role’ I am in at the time too. For example is it a professional role, am I wearing a uniform, is it a social occasion or am I providing a listening ear to a friend?
 
I may not know what some of these things people think about me are, since they may not be expressed openly to me although sometimes we can tell by people’s reactions to us. Where possible I think there is a natural tendency to gravitate towards people with whom we have things in common and who respond positively to us.
 
I wonder if people see me as more capable and ‘together’ than I think I really am but honestly I’m not confident to say what people get wrong about me. Their views will be subjective and influenced by their personal experiences with me and with life, their beliefs and values.
 
I did grow up believing that what other people thought was extremely important but I have thankfully reached an age when this does not concern me as much. Of course, like most people, I want people to like me and think well of me but I can’t control this so I just hope that other people do not judge me too harshly! 
 
On the other hand I grew up influenced by a judgemental attitude towards other people and I have had to try and overcome this and focus on the positive aspects of others but it is a ‘work in progress’. I suspect it probably sits alongside feelings of inferiority and low self esteem which were also pervasive in my family growing up.
