### Parents

### What I disagreed with

This is a tough question for me. It was not common for children to be allowed to express opinions when I was a child, especially not in my case.  Children were supposed to ‘be seen and not heard’ as the expression goes. We did not have dinner table conversations which involved the whole family, for example. In fact I remember my mother saying ‘Less talking and more eating’.
 
My mother was the main presence in our home and she did have quite definite opinions about things which were conveyed to us in various ways. There wasn’t a concept of coparenting, the house and the children were the domain of my mother. Behaviour and opinions were either acceptable or not and whilst I may not have felt comfortable about this, I certainly learnt that it was not possible to argue or disagree with an adult.
 
As a consequence I was very timid and quiet, especially around adults, and my school reports stated I was a ‘quiet student’. In fact the male teacher I had in Grade 4 stated I was ‘too quiet’. This was not considered a problem by anyone else as far as I know, but he obviously realised I was timid and lacking confidence and needed encouragement to speak up and give an opinion.
 
It was not until I was an adult and had left home that I finally felt able to disagree with my parents. The time that sticks in my mind was when I confided in my mother that I had refused a marriage proposal from a boy called Stan. I was just 21 and did not feel ready to get married and start a family. I did feel really conflicted because I did not want to hurt Stan who was very kind and thoughtful and caring. My mother was furious because she thought he was a very good marriage prospect. He was an only child who lived with his mother and grandmother and was five years older than me. He had a steady job and was secure financially. He had never known his father who had been killed during the war. This was a very tumultuous time for me and was the main reason I left Tasmania. Although I was sad to leave the rest of the family for whom I felt very responsible, I felt I had to leave to be able to live my own life and to learn to make my own decisions.
