I don’t remember a lot about the first few years of my life. 

My mother was from Hobart and met my father, a Victorian, during the Second World War. I was born in Melbourne and that is where we lived for the first few years of my life. I do remember playing in a sandpit in Melbourne with some other children but not much else. Luckily I don’t remember my little finger on the left hand getting squashed but it must have been very painful. I’m not sure if you have noticed that it looks strange. Apparently the doctor wanted to amputate the top but my father wouldn’t let him and my father said I didn’t like looking at it and kept saying, ‘cover it up’.

I know that when I was three and my sister was born my aunt came over from Hobart and took me back there for a while. I do have a memory of being on the plane and of the barley sugar they used to give passengers in those days and the other passengers making a fuss of me.

My mother wanted to return to Hobart and we moved there when I was about four years old. At first we lived with my Auntie Dot  (my mother’s sister) and her husband, Uncle Peter. They lived in Bellerive on the eastern shore. People travelled there by ferry if they worked in the city. Uncle Peter used to take me to the beach which was at the end of the street and I really enjoyed that.

The other thing I loved about living there were the dogs. They had tan and white Cocker Spaniels and I loved the way their ears would hang down and get in their food bowl and I like helping to bath them. My aunt had a garden and was very fond of roses and I used to help her water them. She used to rinse my hair with lemon juice to keep it blond but when I got older it turned brown anyway.

I became quite sick while we were living there and it was decided that my tonsils should be removed. I was mortified that I was put in a cot at the hospital as I had not slept in a cot for a long time. I also remember that my throat was so sore I didn’t want to eat anything, even jelly and ice cream! I can’t remember the staff being particularly nice to me and in those days visiting times, even for children’s parents, were very limited.

While we were living there I attended Preschool (Kindergarten). It was not as good as it is today and they made us lie on the floor and have a rest which I didn’t like because I thought I was too big to need a sleep in the daytime. I saw snow for the first time while at Preschool. In Hobart there is often snow on Mt Wellington but snow on the ground in the city and suburbs was very unusual. I didn’t particularly like it because my feet were so cold in my gum boots.

The other memory from this time is of a fancy dress parade when I was dressed as Wee Willy Winky, wearing a long nightie, a nightcap and carrying a candle stick. This was a bit unusual as the other girls were princesses or fairies.

We left Bellerive and moved to a small house in North Hobart, next to the furniture making business that my father was establishing. This was just before I started school. I missed a lot of things about living in Bellerive but one good thing about our new home was that the previous tenants left behind their black and white Manx cat (he didn’t have a tail!) and he became my cat for the rest of my childhood and was my ‘best friend’.
