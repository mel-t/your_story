I have been lucky to have seen some very beautiful places in the world, experienced different cultures, lovely scenery and interesting architecture through short trips and living in places like California, Cambodia and Pakistan. I have mentioned Tasmania elsewhere, where I grew up and which, I think, has so much to offer for a holiday with lovely scenery, wilderness, history and wonderful food from seafood to cheeses to fruit and vegetables and exotic things like truffles. All this in a small area and it is so accessible.
 
Although I had seen a lot of Australia before I was married, My first real overseas trip was to India when I was quite grown up, in fact, married with children. Of course you have all done a lot of travelling already. When Dennis was doing some short term work in India in the mid 1980s at a place called Kanal, north of Delhi, I was able to join him for a few weeks at the end of his time there and we also visited Delhi and Agra. 
 
Dennis met me in Delhi and we travelled by bus to Kanal. I remember sitting in the huge bus station alone while Dennis was purchasing the tickets. There were hundreds of people but not another white face in sight, it was such a feeling of dislocation, of being ‘out of place’. The luxury bus we travelled in had a television which showed Bollywood movies throughout the journey, again a novel experience! The highlight of the journey however, was the trip from Kanal to the Research Institute where Dennis was working for a few more days. We travelled by trishaw (bicycle rickshaw) through the unfamiliar countryside in total darkness, nothing to be seen and the only sound was the whistling of our ‘driver’.
 
India was an assault of the senses with the sounds, the smells, the colours and the overall emotional impact of the cultural differences. I was overwhelmed by the sheer craziness of Delhi traffic, the number of people (I was coming from Shepparton!), the contrasts of poverty and wealth, the beggars, the exquisite Taj Mahal, the beauty of the women with their elegance of bearing and the vibrant colours in their saris. 
 
The Taj Mahal in Agra, seemed, I thought, like a jewel dropped in the mud of its surroundings. I say that because if you looked beyond the gardens immediately around it there was just mud and rubbish.  For me this represents the contrasts of India, the beauty and the ugliness. I read recently that the Taj is under threat. It was constructed from marble and sadly this is being eroded by the high levels of pollution in India.

I have decided that I probably enjoy the natural environment rather than large cities but I have to say I loved Paris when I visited it for the first time in recent years. Many people have said that Paris is their most favourite city in the world so I was prepared to be perverse and not think that! However, it did win me over. There is so much to see, do and taste there. All those lovely cheeses Jess! I have heard so much about Paris over the years, from the time I was learning French in High School so it was quite thrilling to cruise down the Seine under all those famous bridges, to actually see all those places like Notre-Dame, L’ Arc de Triomphe, Sacré-Cœur, Musée d’Orsay and to walk along the Champs-Élysées in real life, to stroll through the fascinating area of Montmartre and to experience the Eiffel Tower at night, covered in lights like a huge Christmas tree.
 
Also, I did find the architecture in Spain, which I visited a couple of years ago, very interesting and particularly the incredible church designed by the visionary Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona, called La Sagrada Familia. This building is breathtaking inside with its soaring white columns over which a myriad colours dance. The constantly changing colours of greens, yellows, reds, oranges and blues, come from the interplay of natural light filtering through beautiful stained glass windows hitting the columns in different ways as the external light changes.

However, a holiday which I really loved was the week I spent with Mark, Jess and Stephanie in rural France. This was in 2009 before any grandchildren were born and it was my very first visit to France.  Mark and Jess were living in London, Stephanie and Pablo were in Italy. We  met Stephanie in Nice then drove to our villa in a small, quiet, picturesque medieval village called Sablet in the Vaucluse region of Provence. The fortified village is built into the hillside and is surrounded by vineyards and fields of sunflowers. Unfortunately we were there in late September so although it was still warm weather it was autumn and the sunflowers were past their best. The narrow, winding streets are lined with stone village houses, there is an old fountain and the village clock on the church chimes on the hour.
 
Our restored 600 year old villa was named ‘Quatre Terrasses’ or Four Terraces 
because it was on several levels and there were four terraces with views of the surrounding countryside. Mark popped out to the nearby boulangerie (bakery) in the morning to buy croissants for breakfast and everyday we would head out in the car to explore the surrounding villages and visit markets, wineries, and historic sites. 
 
We visited a Roman theatre in Orange, a twelfth century chateau, Avignon which I knew from the song, ‘Sur Le Pont d’Avignon’ and Pont du Gard. There we saw a section of what was the 50 km long, three level high Roman Aqueduct. It was built in the first century AD from yellow limestone blocks to take water across the Gardon river to Nimes. It remains an impressive structure..
 
It was a busy week, so much to see and do! The holiday for me included travelling from Nice into Italy and the Côte d’Azur area with Stephanie. We spent a night in Ventimiglia and from there took a very scenic train journey to Torino. Whilst in Torino Pablo and Stephanie took me to Chamonix at the base of Mont Blanc. I was thrilled to not only see Mont Blanc but to go up to a nearby summit by cable car for a closer view.
 
Before flying back to Melbourne I had time in London with Mark and Jess (as I had before France too) so all in all it was a great holiday leaving me with some lovely memories.
