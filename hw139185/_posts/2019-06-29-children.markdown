As a child I always imagined myself as a mother. I seem to remember imagining I would like to have children when I grew up whether I ended up married or not. This, as I realised when I was older, would have been very radical in the 1960s or early 70s! It would have also been quite shocking to my family. In fact the term ‘single mother’ was not a term one heard in those days. I think women in that position were called ‘unmarried mothers’ and they incurred quite a lot of social disapproval so it was not something I thought I could do. Also, once I had children, I couldn’t imagine how anyone would cope as a single parent. I think it would be incredibly challenging.
 
I certainly didn’t rush into marriage and having children in terms of what was ‘the norm’ or expected thing in those days. The standard seemed to be to get married and start a family at 21 or 22. How times have changed! There was someone keen to marry me when I was that age but I didn’t feel ready to ‘settle down’. 
 
I suppose once married we didn’t wait long to have children. It just seemed the appropriate next step and I was keen to be a mother so Simon was born two years later. I was already, at nearly 29, considered ‘old’. The medical label was ‘elderly primigravida’, meaning older than average to be having your first baby! I didn’t feel overly confident with my first baby and looking back I wish I had known then what I know now. I would have been a more relaxed mother. Sorry Simon!
 
It also just seemed logical to have another child although, given that Simon was a rather ‘busy’ child, it wasn’t a rushed decision. Stephanie was born almost three years later. I didn’t think I was focussed on having a daughter, perhaps I saw myself more as the mother of sons, but it was, and is, very special to have a daughter. 
 
Most people were of the opinion that ‘one of each’ was enough, especially when you had a boy and a girl. Families had become a lot smaller but somehow two didn’t seem quite right to me. I was used to a large family as the eldest of six.
 
Therefore, we had our ‘bonus’ or extra child in the form of Mark three and a half years after Stephanie. This was a fairly challenging time since I was in the early stages of pregnancy when Dennis came home and announced that he had the opportunity to go to California for a year’s experience with the US Department of Agriculture. He had been working in Salinity Research at the Victorian Department of Agriculture at Knoxfield in Melbourne and this was a great opportunity to work with American colleagues in this field.
 
So, six months pregnant, with Simon almost six and Stephanie just turned three, we left for Riverside, California with five suitcases. On arrival we had to find an apartment (this was unfurnished), furnish it, buy a car (a Buick station wagon with three rows of seats), find an obstetrician and hospital, a school for Simon and baby things. It was a challenging time and I remember my mother disapproved of my going there to have the baby. It was in fact quite a risk. American health care is not like we are used to in Australia. It is, and was then, very expensive in comparison. Our medical insurance would only cover us for the amount it would cost here in Australia to have a baby and travel insurance would not cover, what was, a ‘pre existing’ complaint.
 
I relied on the fact that I had had two trouble free deliveries and fortunately all went well. It could, however, have been devastating financially if it had not gone well. So, Mark was born in June 1980, just before my 35th birthday which was my personal deadline for having children. We had our ‘American souvenir’ ( a ‘disgustingly healthy’ baby according to the American Paediatrician) who we took back to Australia nine months later.
 
I guess life may have been easier with two, rather than three children but I have never regretted having Mark. Yes, we would probably have been wealthier, two children are easier to travel with etc. Perhaps there are less arguments and sometimes it is more manageable if there is an adult to each child, however I can’t imagine life without our three.
