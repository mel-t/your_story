I do think traditions are great. They give us a sense of comfort, of continuity and allow us to bond and reconnect.
 
Unfortunately we don’t have many traditions in our Australian culture. I know that the year we lived in California I was aware of the fact that they did celebrate more frequently with Halloween (not marked in Australia at the time), Valentines Day (even the children at Stephanie’s Nursery School exchanged cards) and of course Thanksgiving which is perhaps their most important celebration.
 
Growing up I think it was just Christmas and Easter and Christmas was the most important. Of course I like Easter too, with an egg hunt which I started with my children and now we have with their children. 
 
Growing up, Christmas involved having a Nativity Scene in the house which came out each year. The stable was a little wooden shed and the animals and people were plaster so over the years some were broken or had limbs missing. One of my sisters still has this set in its depleted state. We used to sing Christmas Carols around this setting and I suppose that’s where my enjoyment of Christmas Carols began.
 
Plain white pillow slips were hung up at the end of each bed for gifts from Santa and for Santa, a piece of fruitcake and a small glass of sherry were left out. For Rudolph there was a carrot of course. We had a chimney and being summer I suppose there wouldn’t have been a fire, so no problem with access.
 
Of course we (me particularly) woke very early Christmas morning and there was great excitement. Our gifts were quite modest by today’s standards. There was always a cut pine tree which my father purchased quite close to Christmas and I loved the process of decorating the tree and the wonderful smell of the pine when you brushed against it. The house too, was decorated. We made paper chains to hang all over the living room so the house looked very festive.
 
On Christmas morning we went to St James Anglican Church on NewTown Road. There was a good choir all formally dressed in choir robes which added to the occasion, and made the singing of the Carols so much better. The minister would be wearing the full white robes, there were beautiful stained glass windows and the strong smell of white Oriental Lilies. It was quite a special atmosphere.
 
Prior to church we had been allowed to open our gifts from Santa but the presents under the tree were opened when we returned from church. Of course once there were gifts under the tree, there was a lot of examining of the name tags, prodding and shaking in an effort to guess the contents. Again, these gifts were small and often practical things but it was still very exciting.
 
Our Christmas meal was usually chicken because at the time, believe it or not, that was special and not something we ate frequently. There was ham too and a Christmas pudding made by my maternal grandmother. She made the puddings in the traditional English way, boiled in a cloth and hung up several months before Christmas. Before decimal currency we had small silver coins which were safe to hide in the pudding after they had been boiled. Because decimal currency is not safe to hide in food my grandmother saved some of the ‘old money’ for this purpose. It was so exciting to find the sixpence hidden in your slice of pudding.
 
My mother always made a fruitcake and iced it with that special thick almond icing and it would have a small Christmas decoration on top. There was a donation bowl on the table for coins which were given to the Church for missionary work.
 
I guess Christmas for me is a special occasion with the house looking festive, a decorated tree, special food, singing Carols and a coming together of family. Being at the end of the year means it is also a time to reflect on the year, to feel gratitude, to acknowledge achievements and celebrate.
