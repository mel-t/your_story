All seasons have their merits and whilst, for me, a perfect day would probably be a clear 21 degrees, if it was like that everyday I probably wouldn’t appreciate it as much. Just as we need sorrow to really appreciate happiness perhaps we need the extremes of one season to appreciate the pleasant aspects of another season. Not all places have four distinct seasons but I tend to prefer the variety of seasons.
 
Living in Cambodia, the seasons were very different. As in Northern Australia there were two seasons, the ‘wet’ and the ‘dry’. There was great relief when the rain came after a long dry spell, washing the dust from the leaves of plants and refreshing the air a little. Of course it was never cold, although in December, when nighttime temperatures might occasionally dip below twenty degrees, this was referred to as ‘winter’. It was invariably hot and humid and, I have to say, whilst I liked Cambodia, particularly the people, I did not love the climate. For me it was very enervating.
 
I suppose I don’t like the extremes of either summer or winter. I’ve always said I would find winters in places like the UK and Northern Europe hard. I think that the very short and frequently grey days would impact on my mood, inducing SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder).
 
Recalling winters when I was a child in Hobart I remember it being very cold. Our only heating was an open fireplace and I think a small radiator. We would huddle close to the fire so that our fronts became quite warm but you would have to stand with your back to the fire to warm it, always being careful not to get too close! Heating today is more efficient and safer but there is still something enjoyable about gazing into the flames of an open fire. Of course these fires had associated dangers with children, particularly, being burnt when getting too close. To prevent this and to contain hot coals falling from the fire, we had metal ‘fire screens’.
 
The other thing I remember from my childhood winters is the extreme discomfort of chillblains, thought to be brought about by rapidly heating cold feet, for example, sitting close to the fire. Chillblains were painful and itchy blisters that affected the tops of my toes. They are apparently associated with poor circulation, low weight and poor diet and I guess those things did apply to me. I also suffered from another problem of circulation known as ‘Raynaud’s Disease’ and this meant that when I was cold, blood would be depleted in my extremities so that my fingers and toes would lose sensation and turn white. For the first hour or so at school I would have trouble holding a pen and writing.
 
Going to bed at night in winter, the cotton sheets would be icy when I got in so I was always glad to have a hot water bottle and Smoky, my cat, to provide some warmth. Getting dressed in the mornings I would try and put my clothes on while still in bed putting off as long as possible exposing myself to the cold. Thinking about all this I realise I much preferred summer when I was a child, particularly the seasonal fruits and berries and salads that we only had in summer. Unlike today, fruits like strawberries, raspberries and cherries were only available in summer so they were very special.
 
Summer in Hobart tended to be mild and whilst there could be the occasional very hot day there would usually be a ‘change’ mid to late afternoon when the ‘sea breeze’ came sweeping across the city, dropping the temperature many degrees very quickly. If you were at the beach or the pool you would suddenly be scrambling to get dried and dressed and head home. Trips to the beach were rare but when they did happen I’m afraid there was little, if any, awareness of ‘Sun Protection’ and believe it or not, no sunscreens at all. There were ‘sun lotions’ but these were simply oils without any sun screening factor. The result, with my extremely fair skin, is horrifying to recall. Severe painful sunburn, sometimes with blisters and always resulting in peeling some days later were a constant in my childhood and, as for many others in my age group, we are seeing the consequences now.
 
I’m afraid sun damage was not confined to childhood but continued through my teens and twenties although not with such severe burns. Pale skin was considered very unattractive and fake tans were not common and not very good, so endeavouring to get a tan meant quite a lot of time ‘sun baking’. If it was not extremely hot I did find lying in the sun reading very pleasant. Unfortunately years spent in places with hot weather have continued to contribute to my sun damage so these days I have to avoid the sun which means going to the beach on a hot day is not very enjoyable anymore.
 
I find that winter is not too bad here in Melbourne if you have a warm house and warm clothing and are not standing about in a cold wind. During lockdown this winter of 2020, I was able to get out for a walk almost every day for the hour we were allowed. Cold winds are not enjoyable though and, as my grandmother would say, ‘That’s a lazy wind, it won’t go around you and goes straight through you’. Also, I don’t like days with low, grey clouds, they do seem to dampen my mood. Cold nights with frosts were a feature of winters in Shepparton but the days were invariably clear and sunny which made the cold nights worthwhile.
 
As I write this it is November and today is 33 degrees with hot winds from the north. Days like this are not pleasant outdoors and the garden doesn’t like it either, with plants being battered about. Of course, Melbourne is known for having a variable climate and it continues to live up to its reputation of ‘four seasons in one day’.
 
For me, the ‘between’ seasons of Spring and Autumn are the best ones. It is always exciting to see the first buds appearing on the deciduous trees, spring bulbs poking through the earth, the first daffodils appearing, fruit trees coming into blossom, birds busy nest building and to be aware of a lifting of spirits, a surging of energy, new life and renewal. Spring seems to bring a sense of optimism, of things to look forward to.
 
But I do love autumn when the sun has lost its ‘sting’, it is milder and gentler on the skin and I particularly love the glorious colours of the deciduous trees and vines. It is, traditionally, the season of harvest and in many places they hold Harvest Festivals to celebrate the produce that autumn provides. Autumn seems to be a season for contemplation I somehow think. For me autumn is so perfectly described by the Romantic poet, John Keats in ‘To Autumn’,
 
                            Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness, 
                                 Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;
                            Conspiring with him how to load and bless
                                  With fruit the vines that round the thatch eves run;
                            To bend with apples the mossed cottage trees,
                                 And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;
