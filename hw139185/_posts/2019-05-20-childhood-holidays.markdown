It probably seems odd to you but we didn’t have any family holidays when I was growing up in Hobart. I was the eldest of six children and we were not well off. People did not have so many holidays in those days which were the 1950s. I did know some other families who went on holidays, some even flew to ‘The Mainland’ to places like Queensland.  I don’t think any families I knew ever went overseas for a holiday.

My Dad worked very hard and long hours building up his furniture manufacturing business and my mother was busy with running the house. I suppose we could have done something like a camping holiday or to stay in a beach shack but my mother was not keen on that kind of thing as she thought that would not be much of a holiday for her. Because I didn’t have family holidays growing up I made a special point of making sure that we had family holidays when I had my own children.

During school holidays when I was in Primary School I sometimes went to stay with a cousin of my mother’s who lived down the Channel in a fishing village called Kettering. Nearly everyone there was part of the Sward family and most of them were professional fishermen.

My mother’s cousin’s name was Dolly and her husband, Vic, was the person in charge of the ferry that took people across from Kettering to Bruny Island. I really didn’t know them before I went to stay with them so it was a bit strange at first. I remember playing Ludo with Vic and  Dolly taught me to knit. They only had one son who was grown up. Next to their house was an empty paddock where hundreds of wild jonquils grew in early Spring. They had a terrier dog who was called Nip and I loved him too as we didn’t have space for a dog in Hobart.

I enjoyed being away from the city. I remember thinking I would prefer to live in the country. Going to Kettering exposed me to a different way of life and people who were very different from my family so it was probably an important learning experience for me.
