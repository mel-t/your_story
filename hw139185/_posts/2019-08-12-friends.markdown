I did not have a wide circle of friends in childhood. I was rather shy at that time and because I didn’t stay at school for lunch I didn’t mix with the other children then. We had our main meal in the middle of the day back then so I always went home at lunch time. We were not close to the school. It was a long walk or a bus ride and a shorter walk and nobody else lived near me.
 
There was a friend who was at Primary School with me and also at High School. Carol always had a birthday party each year and invited me. Because her birthday was on Guy Fawkes Day there was a bonfire and fireworks which was very exciting. Carol married when she was quite young and I left Tasmania but she always kept in touch with me and visited me over the years and I would see her when I was in Hobart. Unfortunately Carol developed a brain tumour a few years ago and died but I saw her daughter recently when she came to Melbourne.
 
I had a very close friend called Jill Kauffman when I was in first year High School. Jill and I were very close and could talk for hours. Jill’s family were Jewish and I suspect her mother may have been in a concentration camp during the war. I seem to remember she had some sort of mark tattooed on her arm. I know she had asthma and never seemed very well. Jill’s family had a delicatessen in the centre of Hobart. When I had sleepovers at her house everything was a little exotic. This was the first time I had seen a continental quilt (or doona). We only had sheets and blankets in those days. Also the food was different. There were very few Jewish people in Hobart at that time so sadly for me, Jill’s family moved to Melbourne to live in St Kilda. I did miss her dreadfully. We wrote frequent, long letters to each other and I think I have mentioned going to visit her a year or two after they moved.
 
We grew apart when I went nursing and Jill was still at school in Melbourne. I suppose I had to grow up quickly in my situation so we didn’t have much in common at that time. One thing that I was very sad about was that her family were visiting Hobart some years later and one of her parents rang my parent’s house. One of my sisters answered the phone and just said I was not in Hobart but did not get any contact details. So, I lost touch with Jill. However, I have often thought that it would have been nice to track her down and meet up with her again.
 
When I left school I went nursing and I have just recently visited one of my friends from that time. Sue lives in Maleny in Queensland and we now play Words With Friends together. Sue and I had some adventures together travelling around Tasmania in her grandmother’s car on our days off from nursing.
 
I have also kept in touch with another friend from those days who has moved back to Hobart and last time I was in Hobart a group of us who all started our nursing together met up. When you are older, It is rather nice to have friends you have known since you were young, people you shared life changing experiences with.
