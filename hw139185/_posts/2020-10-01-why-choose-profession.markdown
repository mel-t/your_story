When I was deciding what to do there were not as many choices of occupations as there are today. For me it seemed to be teaching or nursing. Some courses, such as Social Work or Medicine or Allied  Health courses were not available in Hobart at that time. Many occupations that exist today, did not exist then as there have been such major developments in technology in the last 50 years.

Many girls learnt typing and became secretaries and worked in offices but that was not something I considered. Also, I had my matriculation which meant I was qualified for University, although, the attitude in society was that girls did not need to be highly educated and go to University and not many people went to University.

The expectation was that girls would only work for a few years after leaving school and then they would get married at about 21 and not work after that. It was thought that you would stay home and be a ‘housewife’. In fact, things changed dramatically in the following years and my generation of women are the first generation to have kept working throughout their lives even if they stopped for a few years when they had children.

So, why did I decide to be a nurse? I did have a strong desire to help people, to care for them and I thought nursing would allow me to do that. Another factor was that in those days you lived at the hospital in accommodation provided while you studied and you were paid, not much, but it meant I could be independent. This was important as I was the eldest of six children. It was called ‘hospital based training’. These days nurses study at University. Also, nursing was socially approved of as a suitable occupation for girls and a good basis for marriage and motherhood so that may have been a factor in my decision.

However, I did go on to do a lot of other things in the years that followed. I did feel that my hospital based training had not provided me with a very good education. It was more practical and there was a lot more I wanted to learn. I started doing an Arts Degree at University when I got married and did a lot of part time study in the years after that in between having children and working part time. I qualified as a Social Worker and a Nurse Educator.

In Shepparton I worked in oncology for a while looking after people who had cancer. This involved visiting people at home and supporting them and their families when they were very sick and perhaps not going to recover. This was rewarding but quite draining. 

I did quite a lot of community work such as health promotion, community development and had a weekly program on community radio in Shepparton called ‘Health News and Views’. The radio work was voluntary and I enjoyed interviewing people from across the health sector. Some of my community work involved working with people from different cultural backgrounds.

However, in the end I did do teaching and I really did like it although I was not teaching school children. I taught a variety of subjects to nursing students, welfare workers, aged care workers and child care workers. In the final years of my working life I taught University students studying health related courses. What I liked about it was that I was learning things myself while teaching. For example I taught a Public Health subject and this included discussing the impact of climate change on human health. This is something that is, only now, gaining more attention.

There were times when I wasn’t able to work because we were overseas. This included the years spent in California, Pakistan and Cambodia. I was able to do a little voluntary work. 

I believe I was fortunate to have a supportive husband who encouraged me to do further study later in life because not all women did, and lucky to have the opportunities to take on a number of roles throughout my working life.
