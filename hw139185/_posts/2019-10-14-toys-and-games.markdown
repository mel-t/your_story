My most important toy was a bear called ‘Bobo’. Bobo was made during the war years when supplies of traditional teddy bears were scarce, Bobo was a koala bear made from sheepskin. He was much loved and I still have him but he does look very shabby with missing eyes and a lot of his fur (wool) worn away. I was told that when I was very young I would not go to bed without him so he had to be found at bedtime. I think that reminds me of someone else I know! Somehow I have never felt like throwing Bobo away.

I did not have any construction toys such as LEGO like you have. LEGO wasn’t around then. There was Meccano which was made from metal but that seemed to be something only boys had. I suppose I mainly played ‘house’ in my playhouse which I have mentioned before. I guess you would call it a ‘cubby house’. My doll’s name was Susie and I spent a lot of time dressing and undressing her and things like that. I’m afraid that I was quite ‘territorial’ and did not allow my younger siblings into this space as it was a challenge to keep my things safe from them. I also had a tea set and had pretend tea parties. As I write this it seems very clear that I was following a ‘gender stereotype’ - girls played with different things. Perhaps if I had had a brother close to me in age I may have had an opportunity to play with different things.

When I was older I enjoyed playing board games such as Ludo, Chinese Checkers and Snakes and Ladders or simple card games like Snap. Most of my siblings were not old enough to play these things with me at the time but I remember playing Chinese Checkers with the husband of my mother’s cousin when I stayed with them in school holidays. I probably played these too if I occasionally visited a friend’s house.

There wasn’t much opportunity for physical games. As I’ve said before, our backyard was small and there weren’t any parks or playgrounds around. Also, participation in any kind of sporting activities did not seem to be an option somehow so it was a fairly sedentary childhood. Of course we did play hide and seek - that seems to be a game that is played by every child in every generation I think!

When I complained that I was bored my mother would give me a long word and I would then try to make as many words as I could using those letters so perhaps that fostered an interest in word games.
