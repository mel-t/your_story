I suppose I could stretch a point and say I first moved ‘overseas’ when I left Tasmania at the end of my initial three year hospital training!
 
I definitely wanted to explore the world beyond Tasmania, to visit new places, meet new people and generally expand my horizons. When I first left Tasmania I flew to Perth in Western Australia with some nursing friends. While I was there I completed a six month course in Paediatrics at The Princess Margaret Children’s Hospital. 
 
I also made new friends and was able to see some of the country outside Perth as I had a friend who owned a little VW car. At the completion of my course I did a three week bus camping trip from Perth to Darwin with a girl from England who was working at the hospital too. That was a marvellous experience, quite a budget tour, certainly not ‘glamping’. We pitched our own tents and bought and cooked our own food along the way. It was supposed to be a trip for ‘Under 30’s’ and most of us were in our early twenties but there was one older woman who hadn’t read the fine print. She was a Social Worker at The Children’s Hospital in Melbourne and I visited her a few times after that when I was passing through Melbourne. 
 
From Darwin I made my way down to Alice Springs by bus with some of the other people from the trip. We had a couple of nights there and were able to visit the West MacDonnell National Park and Standley Chasm before catching another bus to Adelaide and from there to Melbourne. I flew back to Hobart from Melbourne to be bridesmaid for my friend Sue Hall who lives in Queensland.

In the following few years I lived and worked in Sydney where I did my Midwifery course, in New Zealand where I worked for a Pathology firm in Auckland and at an orchard in Motueka in the South Island (this was a break from hospitals and nursing). Returning to Australia I spent a few months in Brisbane then arrived in Melbourne where I was working as a District Nurse out of the Heidelberg Centre and it was at this time that I met Dennis. The following year we were married and I started my Arts Degree at Monash.
