I was the eldest in my family. To be honest I don’t think I was very pleased when my siblings came along. I suspect I was jealous because this meant I didn’t get as much attention.

I was three and a half when my first sister was born and I think there was always some competition between us. Another sister was born two years later but we were never close growing up. My role was very much being the ‘big sister’ and helping my mother. Because my father was very busy with his business my mother needed me to help her look after the other children.

I was eight years old when my brother was born. It was a novelty having a brother and I was old enough to really enjoy him. He was quite sick as a baby and we were very worried about him but he got better and was very cute as a toddler with chubby cheeks and blond curls. I used to like looking after him. 

When I was a bit older I sometimes took my two sisters and brother to the local cinema. I remember taking them to see ‘The Wizard of Oz’ but they were scared of the witch and hid under the seats!

Another memory from my childhood is sharing a bedroom with my two sisters. The beds were close enough to be able to jump from one to another and I invented this game of running around, jumping from one bed to the next.

Two more sisters arrived after my brother. It was hoped that one would be a boy so my brother could have a brother. I had nearly finished high school when my youngest sister was born and left to go nursing when she was still a baby so I did not grow up with her at all.

As children, we played the same sort of games that you play, like hide and seek and card games like Snap, drawing and colouring activities and pretending to be mothers with our dolls as children. I had a tea set and would have pretend afternoon tea parties. We didn’t have television but we listened to children’s programs on the radio.
