I am writing this in the year 2020 and you may remember what happened then. At the beginning of the year we started to hear about a new virus in China that was spreading very quickly and making many people sick. Some people didn’t even recover. It started to spread to other countries and was very bad in Italy. 
 
It seemed that people who had been travelling overseas sometimes became infected and when they returned to Australia they brought the virus with them. Infectious disease experts and health professionals were concerned that hospitals here would not be able to manage if large numbers of people became sick so the government had to take action. 
 
Because the infection was spread from person to person, ‘social distancing’ rules were implemented. Restaurants, theatres, gyms and cinemas were closed and people could not gather together in large groups. Most people worked from home and children did their school work at home too as I’m sure you remember. 
 
These things meant that I mostly saw you ‘online’ or at a distance outdoors. This made me think about the things that are important and what I enjoy doing. The health and well being of my family and spending time with them is very important. We were not able to gather together as a group at Easter for the egg hunt which we all missed even if you had your own egg hunts. What I found especially hard was not being able to give you a hug even if I did see you outdoors at a distance.  We had to have ‘air hugs’ which are not nearly as good.  Hugs are the most important ‘simple pleasure’ in life.
 
Some things that I enjoy doing I was still able to do, such as going for a walk outdoors. In fact this seemed particularly important when the rest of the time I was in the house. I was still able to enjoy watching the dogs at the park, the flowers in people’s gardens and the autumn colours on the trees. 
 
Other things I like to do, such as going to a movie or eating at a restaurant, I was not able to do, but keeping in touch with family and friends was very important I found. The groups I belong to, such as choir and book group, could not meet so we had to have ‘Zoom’ meetings. This was not quite the same as meeting face to face but certainly better than nothing. In fact lots of things happened online, even my U3A lunch group! Also, I enjoyed reading stories with some of you on ‘FaceTime’ during this period and even helping Maddy a little bit with her school work.
 
I’ve noticed that certain smells give me pleasure, for example the smell of flowers such as lavender, violets or roses or the smell of herbs such as basil or rosemary, the smell of the bush after rain and even certain timbers such as Huon Pine. When I open the polished drop leaf desk (I think it is walnut) that once belonged to my father I notice a lovely woody smell. I do love flowers, not just for the smell and it always gives me pleasure to have flowers in the house.
