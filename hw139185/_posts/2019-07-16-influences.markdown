Many people have influenced me over the course of my life and I think still do. Sometimes it has been people close to me such as family members or friends, at other times a person I have had a lot of contact with for a period of time such as a teacher at school or someone I knew well who was a neighbour. I do think also that I have been greatly influenced by authors through the books I have read.

All these people have had some influence on me but for me, as for most people, my parents would have been the greatest influence growing up, particularly my mother. From my parents I learnt resilience, the importance of working hard and doing one’s best, being responsible and probably most of all caring for other people. From my mother I learnt to value education, to love music and language and from my father I learnt that humour can put things in perspective and lift mood. From my aunt and grandmother I learnt to love dogs, flowers and good food and from my godmother the joy of travel.

Some people taught me practical skills such as my ‘Brown Owl’ who was my leader when I was in Brownies. I still remember how she taught me to sew on buttons. In Brownies and Guides we not only learnt practical skills and had experiences that were novel for me, like hiking and camping, but we learnt the value of teamwork.

I loved reading and it was in books that I learnt about other people, other cultures and ways of living and people who were less fortunate than I was. Some of the authors I read in high school such as Charles Dickens influenced me greatly. 

As a child I was mainly influenced by the adults around me but as an adult I have come to understand and learn from students I have taught and patients I have cared for as a nurse and now I can learn from my grandchildren who are growing up in a world that is so different from the world of my children. 

From older people I learnt that we all get old and we should treat others as we would want to be treated if we were in that position. When caring for people who were dying I learnt that we should not live in the future but ‘live each day as if it is our last’, to not put off saying and doing those things we want to say and do.

The most important thing I have learnt is that the world is a fascinating place and there is always more to learn and experience and try to understand. Above all though, it is realising our relationships with those closest to us are all that matters in the end.
