I suppose unexpected compliments come ‘out of the blue’, not when you are doing nor have done anything very impressive but perhaps just in the course of a general conversation or task. Over my lifetime I must have had a few compliments but most I have forgotten. Some compliments related to my appearance, such as, ‘You always look nice’, others to some accomplishment such as something I cooked or an ability such as, ‘You are a quick thinker’ or ‘You write well’. The latter was not referring to handwriting by the way!

It is always nice to receive a compliment, particularly when you feel it is genuine. One unexpected compliment I remember was when I was about 17 or 18 and a young student nurse. An elderly lady I was caring for suddenly looked at me intently and said, ‘ You have beautiful eyes, make sure you use them’. I was not sure what she meant and it could be interpreted in several different ways perhaps. I have a feeling that she meant eyes should be used to flirt with but I now believe we should use our eyes to see in a mindful way. There is an expression, ‘Stop and Smell the Roses’ which is about appreciating what is around us. Perhaps this year many of us, whilst restricted to our five kilometre radius, learnt to see what was in our immediate surroundings.

A very recent compliment came from someone who is just getting to know me. Hesitantly, she said, ‘You are a little bit impulsive’. I laughed and said, ‘Oh yes, I’m afraid I am’. Then she said, ‘I think it’s endearing’. This was a different take on impulsiveness which I thought of as perhaps less than desirable.

Some years ago I did a stint of newspaper reading in Shepparton for a local radio service for people with vision impairment. One of my fellow presenters commented to someone else that, ‘Helen has a nice laugh’. Perhaps I remember this because the person who made the remark was not a particular friend of mine and it was not something I had ever thought about nor something that anyone had ever remarked on before.

Whilst compliments are nice to receive it is important of course to remember to give compliments to others rather than expect them yourself. I have learnt that we can’t rely on other people to constantly make us feel good or worthwhile, rather we have to try to foster our own self esteem.
