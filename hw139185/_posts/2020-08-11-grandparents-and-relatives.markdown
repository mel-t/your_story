I have fond memories of my maternal grandmother. Unfortunately I never met my father’s mother who died in Northern Victoria before I grew up and was able to visit her.

My maternal grandparents, Leslie and May Davis, known to us as Nanna and Grandpop, lived on Battery Point, an historic area of Hobart settled around 1804, within walking distance of the city. It is built on a point of land that juts out into the Derwent River and its name derives from the battery of guns established there in 1818 as part of Hobart’s coastal defence. There is still a decommissioned one there in Princes Park.

Battery Point has some lovely old sandstone colonial architecture and restored working class cottages. The area has now become very fashionable and popular with tourists but this was not the case when I was a child. My grandparents’ house was a very modest weatherboard cottage purchased in their middle years. Prior to that they lived in a rented house in the area.

I have memories of walking around Battery Point with my grandmother. The most interesting part for me was ‘Arthur’s Circus’ where there is a central ‘village green’ with quaint little cottages built in the 1840’s and 1850’s all around the edge. It is called ‘Arthur's Circus’ because Lieutenant Governor George Arthur owned the land and  I guess, ‘circus’ relates to the layout of the houses around the central green like a circus arena. These working class little cottages had only two rooms originally but today they have been modernised internally, restored externally and are prime real estate.

Nanna was quiet, unassuming, practical and thoughtful. Her life centred around the domestic sphere and she had a strict routine to her day and her week (unfortunately I am not like that!). In the morning Nanna would do her housework, (the washing was done on a certain day of the week) and then she would go to the nearby shops in Hampden Road such as the Baker, Butcher, and Grocer. In the afternoon she would often go to visit friends or relatives.

Every Wednesday she would catch two buses and come to our house to help my mother. She attacked the permanent mountain of ironing, she hung out washing, she brought in washing and folded it, she cleaned windows and did dishes. When we couldn’t find something in the kitchen we would say, ‘Nanna has been here!’. When she left we would walk with her to the bus stop. She always wore a hat and gloves and inside her glove she would have the coins for her bus fare and some spare coins which she would give us before she got on the bus.

She loved flowers, as I do, and I always associate her with pansies which she had growing in her small front garden whilst my grandfather used the back garden to grow vegetables. I suppose there was a strict ‘gender division’ of labour in that house which was the norm in those days and I associate their little house with orderliness and consistency as opposed to the more unpredictable and somewhat chaotic nature of my family home.

I remember Nanna taking me Christmas shopping and helping me choose a gift for my mother, something I always agonised over. When I was quite young I remember her making me hot blackcurrant drinks for my sore throat. She would put a large spoonful of her homemade blackcurrant jam in a glass and add hot water. Nanna was a good traditional cook. She made jams, she made scones, she always cooked a traditional Christmas pudding in a cloth long before Christmas and I loved her boiled custard. The last time I saw my grandmother was just before I married. It was very sad because she had developed dementia and lost her memory.

My grandfather was a little intimidating when I was a young child. He was a manual labourer who loved hunting and fishing and would go camping in the Great Lakes to catch fish. As a young teenage boy he ran away to sea after his mother died and his father remarried. He loved to sit on his front verandah with his binoculars and watch the yachts sailing on the Derwent River and the ships heading down to Constitution Dock. His other great love was Australian Rules football. His team was Sandy Bay. The other thing I remember was that he loved to engage in debate about politics and religion. He made his own pickled onions and had built himself a smokehouse where he smoked mutton birds that he brought back from mutton birding trips. The last time I saw him was when I was leaving Hobart when I was in my early twenties. He told me that he would not be there when I returned and he did indeed die while I was away after breaking his hip and developing pneumonia.

I believe I was fortunate to have two women in my life for whom I was ‘special’. They were both childless. One was my mother’s sister, Auntie Dot. I had a lot to do with her in my early years and I guess I was always the favourite niece. She was my role model as a ‘working woman’ because my mother did not go out to work. Auntie Dot loved flowers and gardening, she was a very good cook and accomplished in needlework. I still have some small tablecloths that she embroidered with crocheted edges.

The other important person in my life was my godmother, Oak. Her maiden name was ‘Oakley’ and she had been a nurse with my mother in Campbell Town during the war where she acquired the nickname, ‘Oak’. She lived in Launceston so I didn’t see her frequently during my childhood but she kept in close contact and when I was doing my nursing training I would catch the train from Hobart to visit her for a few days. Oak was working as a nurse until marrying a widower later in life. She knitted and crocheted many jumpers for me and loved having me visit her especially when her husband died and she was alone.

I think all these people influenced me and I was fortunate to have them in my life.
