Probably changing my mind about certain things has happened in a gradual way due to changing social values, becoming more educated and studying subjects such as Sociology, also travelling, living in different countries and meeting a broad spectrum of people.

It is hard for me to remember what I believed 50 years ago however there are a few things that spring to mind.

I have learnt not to care so much about what others think, that our self esteem should not depend on what others think about things such as the way we dress, where we live, what material possessions we have or what job we do. It was a constant concern when I was a child, ‘What would people think’, but society is more casual and accepting of differences these days. It is who we are as a person, our character, that is important. Most people are too busy thinking about their own issues to care anyway.

When I was young I believed my main purpose was to please other people but I have slowly come to realise that we are entitled to recognise our own needs and unless we like and care for ourselves we can’t appreciate and care for other people. I also thought that I should try to be perfect in everything I did which is ridiculous of course. It is called being a ‘perfectionist’ and I’m still trying to change that attitude. 

I suspect I may have tended to see issues and people in ‘black and white’ terms when I was young. This means something was either right or wrong and a person was either good or bad. I have come to realise that there are two sides to every story, that nobody is totally good or totally bad. When we understand someone’s story we can better understand their behaviour even if we don’t approve of it. An important thing I have learnt is that people have the capacity to change and they should have the opportunity to prove that. In other words, we should not judge them too harshly.

I think an important thing that travel has taught me is that whilst people may be from a very different culture, speak a different language and have a different life style, our differences are not as great as the things we have in common.
