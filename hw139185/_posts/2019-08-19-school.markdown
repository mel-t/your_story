I attended Hobart High School when I left Campbell Street Primary School. At that time there was a streaming process for State Secondary Schools. In Grade 6 we sat an exam, called an ‘Ability Test’ to see where we should go. It was, I guess, a kind of Intelligence Test but it was a very stressful experience for me because I knew that it was important to go to Hobart High as this was considered the best. 
 
Hobart High offered a more academic curriculum than the other schools that offered technical subjects for boys and subjects for girls to prepare them for office work.
This selective system was abolished a few years later and zoning was introduced. Tasmania then developed ‘Matriculation Colleges’ for the final two years of High School and Hobart High became a ‘Matric College’.
 
In first year all the girls had to do sewing for the first half of the year and then cooking for the other half. I didn’t really like sewing, where we had to make a white overall which we then wore for cooking class. I didn’t particularly enjoy cooking class either because the teacher was large, loud and quite terrifying. The only thing I remember is that her favourite saying was ‘Garnish with parsley’!
 
I did find High School very overwhelming when I first went. Instead of one room and one teacher we had different teachers for every subject and had to keep moving rooms. When I think about the subjects I enjoyed I suppose a lot of it depended on the teacher. For example, I didn’t particularly like maths but one year when I had a good teacher it was better.
 
My preferred subject was English Literature, probably because I enjoyed reading. We studied mainly English authors such as Charles Dickens, Shakespeare and Jane Austen. Our English teacher one year was called Mr Body. He was a very large man with a large personality and a very small car. He eventually left teaching and became a food writer.
 
I quite liked languages too. French was compulsory for the first few years but I also chose to do German as an elective after first year. The teacher was German and he must have been good because some of it is still there somewhere in my brain and I have been told my pronunciation is OK. Our French teacher taught us some songs in French which I enjoyed. Our textbook featured a boy called Toto who was always getting into trouble. There was an emphasis on grammar and I didn’t really grasp the pronunciation as well as I did German. 
 
As far as the sciences went I preferred Biology and Geology. On one occasion we had to go hiking around the top of Mt Wellington. I didn’t have any hiking boots so a neighbour lent me hers. Unfortunately they were a little big and I developed the most awful blisters which were very painful and took a long time to heal and in fact my heels were never quite the same again!
 
I only spent five years in High School because we were able to qualify for Matriculation and University entrance in our fifth year. As I said this changed when they brought in Matriculation Colleges a few years later. At Hobart High School the aim was to prepare people for University but in those days only a small proportion of people went on to University. Although I passed my Matriculation exams I went nursing when I left school and did not go to University until 1972, the year I was married. This was considered rather a strange thing to do at the time!
