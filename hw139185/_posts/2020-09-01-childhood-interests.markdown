### Interests

When I was a child we did not have television. It came to Hobart when I was a teenager but it was only black and white television. We did not have one in our house until I finished school and was living in the nursing quarters so I hardly ever watched it. I know everyone was very excited when it first came to Hobart but the screens were small and the quality of the programs and the reception was not very good. People used to stand outside the shops that sold televisions because they would have them set up and playing in the shop windows.
 
We always had the radio on in our house when I was a child and it was always on the ABC. In those days the announcers and news readers did not have Australian accents. Often they were English immigrants or they were Australians who had learnt to speak with a rather ‘proper’ English accent. I didn’t find the news very interesting but enjoyed musical programs and as I got older the British comedies. There was a long running serial called ‘Blue Hills’. I don’t know what it was about really but I remember the music. 
 
The children’s program I listened to was called ‘The Argonauts’ and later the ‘Children’s Hour’ which was broadcast from Melbourne. It was on from 5 pm to 6 pm six days a week. It was discontinued eventually when television became popular. The section I most enjoyed was the dramatised version of The Muddled-Headed Wombat written by Ruth Park. This series on radio was before the books were written. The characters of Wombat, Mouse and Tabby Cat were so well done, I absolutely loved it and maybe that’s why I still have a soft spot for wombats!
 
But really it was reading that I loved best of all. There weren’t as many books for children in those days as there are now. ‘Boys Own Annual’ and ‘Girls Own Annual’ were large hard cover books of short stories published annually prior to Christmas. They were written about children in England so there were lots of stories about girls in boarding schools and generally a life quite different from mine. It was common to get one of these at Christmas.
 
The Australian books I loved were The Magic Pudding and Blinky Bill. I still have my copy of Blinky Bill but it is looking a bit worn. I loved the language in The Magic Pudding, the verses are such fun. The other favourites were Winnie the Pooh and as I got older Enid Blyton’s adventure books, The Secret Seven and The Famous Five. The children in these stories had such free and adventurous lives which I could immerse myself in and share for a time.
 
I think it is books and reading that can open up your world, educate, inform, amuse and entertain. A good book is one that you never want to finish!

### Weekends
I guess the main thing about the weekends when I was growing up was that we didn’t go to school. We didn’t have any regular special activities such as outings or playing sport. There was often homework to do, especially in High School.

There were usually household chores on Saturday and I used to help with my younger siblings as my father would have been working. I mentioned elsewhere that when there were children’s films on at the State Theatre I would often go on Saturday afternoons.

On Sunday there was Sunday School in the morning at St James Church in NewTown and there was alway a roast dinner (most often lamb) after that. I know the washing up after that seemed to take forever!

As I got older I was sometimes invited to a friend’s place at the weekend and when we got a car we would occasionally go for a drive on Sunday afternoons but my main memory of weekends is that they were rather uneventful!
