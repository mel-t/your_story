My dad was the biggest influence in the earlier part of my life. He taught me how to survive in life and the philosophy of being a good person. He preached to me that money is not more important than health and happiness in life and to always work hard and be close to your family.

Before he passed away, when I visited him, he still reminded me of all the things he taught me. My last memory of my dad was his waving goodbye to me from the window upstairs. From then on, I knew that was the last time I would see him again. My only regret is that my dad never saw my children and hopefully, I have not let him down.

The other person that influenced me in the later part of my life was my husband. He persuaded me to further my studies and I ended up in a career that I enjoyed until I retired to start a family.
