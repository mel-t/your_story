My favorite family traditions are Chinese New Years Eve, where all my siblings came to celebrate with my parents. On New Years Day we visited relatives and collected red packets. On my mum and dadâ€™s birthdays we had big gatherings with all the siblings. Over here in Australia I have tried to do the same with my children and grandchildren. We celebrate Christmas and all the birthdays. For Chinese New Year we usually go out to celebrate with family and friends.
