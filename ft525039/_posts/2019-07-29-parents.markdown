As a child I was closer to my mum. She was there to make sure we are well fed and happy. Also instilled on us to look after each other. As I grew older I was closer to my dad. My mom was busy looking after the grandchildren. Also dad was there to give advice and help when I needed. I only spend my last few years with him as a teenager. I left Singapore when I was around my mid twenty to Australia and stay on as a citizen.
