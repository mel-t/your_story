In the earlier years I kept in touch with my friends because we visited Singapore quite frequently. My school friends are living in Singapore and we keep in touch with letters and when I visited Singapore. Over the last couple of years we have lost touch because all of us are busy with extended family. Hopefully we will catch up in person when I next visit Singapore.
