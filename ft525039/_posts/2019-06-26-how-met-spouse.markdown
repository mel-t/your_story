I knew my spouse since we were in Grade 5 until we left for secondary school. One day he wrote me a letter for our first date. We hit off very well. I was interested in studies but he convinced me to take my Cambridge School Certificate if I wanted to look for a job.

We dated for a while and out of the blue he decided to further his studies in Australia. We were in love so it was a very difficult decision to make to go with him. It was such a big move for me, especially as I am very close to my family.

Somehow I decided to go with him to Australia. Because of our Chinese culture we had to get engaged before we headed off to Australia.

We arrived in Australia as mature students in 1970. Since I was only given a 1 year student visa, immediately after my course I had to leave Australia. But my spouse had another 3 years to go for his course. The only option I had was to get married and stay on. We decided to do that and eventually we made our home here. We are very happy and have a wonderful family.
