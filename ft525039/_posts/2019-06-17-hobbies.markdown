In my earlier years in Singapore I loved playing badminton and running, as I was influenced by my brothers. I also loved collecting coins and stamps. 

When I arrived in Australia I still continued to play badminton with university students. I also met some friends who taught me how to knit and sew. I really enjoyed knitting jumpers to wear in Winter. 

I had to give up my hobbies and concentrate on being a mum. In my late fifties I was introduced to golf by my husband. I am still playing golf and enjoying it. Lastly, my most enjoyable hobby now is playing with my grandchildren.
