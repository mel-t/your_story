When I completed my Cambridge School Certificate in Singapore I thought that I better look for a job and be independent. Looking through the job advertisements I came across this interesting position called "Key Punch Operator" in the computer department at the Caterpillar Company. I applied and got the job. I was trained for the position and worked there happily until I left for Australia in 1970.

When I arrived in Australia in 1970 I went to Scotts Business College in Melbourne to do my Secretary and Administration Course for a year. After that I landed a Secretarial job at Reg Hunt Motors for a few months. Then I applied for a Secretary/Administration job at Shell Company in Melbourne and worked there for 4 years before transferring to Geelong Shell Refinery. From there I was promoted to Supervisor of Administration Services at the Refinery. I worked there until I retired to have children.
