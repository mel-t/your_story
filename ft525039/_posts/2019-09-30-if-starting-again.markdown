Looking back on my career, I really enjoyed working as a Secretary and in later years as an Administration Manager. I liked the people I associated with. But if I had another chance, I would really like to be a nurse. I always wanted to help people who are sick or helpless. I think that will fulfill my dreams as a young kid. But I never regret my other careers.
