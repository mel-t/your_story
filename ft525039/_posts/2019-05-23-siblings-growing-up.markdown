During my earlier years I spent most of my time with my brothers. Being in the middle of the family, my older sisters didn't include me in their company because I was too young to associate regarding boyfriends. They spent a lot of time talking about boys. I spent time with my brothers, going bike riding and catching spiders. What I enjoyed most was tree climbing and picking fruits from our neighbor's gardens. I played a lot with my brothers and my closest sibling was my older brother Tommy. Only later in my teens, I started to be closer to my 2nd and 3rd sisters.
