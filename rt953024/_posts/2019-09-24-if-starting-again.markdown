I would not change a thing.

My Career as Head of Information Technology Services at Deakin University was able to provide me with the right balance between work and home life that enabled me to be actively involved in the raising of my family while they were in their primary and secondary school phase.
 
My job exposed me to a wide range of contacts and responsibilities at both a local and international level, including involvement in the planning of future directions for Information Technology for the whole of Deakin University and the development of staff and their careers within the IT division. 
 
It has been a most satisfying career with virtually never a dull moment because of the dynamic changes in IT.

I summarise my response by saying that it was great to be **paid to indulge in your hobby**.
