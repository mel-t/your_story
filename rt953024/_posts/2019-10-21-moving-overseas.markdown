I moved to Australia in order to further my education (Industrial Design). I couldnâ€™t do this in Singapore as I was one of less than a handful of staff within the Singapore Ministry of Education to have formal qualifications in advanced Geometrical, Building and Mechanical Drafting. In addition, I was a teacher and excelled in the craft of Woodworking.
