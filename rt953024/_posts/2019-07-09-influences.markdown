Biggest influences in my life (in no order of priority):

### My Wife
The one constant in my life. One that I can unreservedly trust and count on. Keeps my feet on the ground and not get carried away. Provides the love and commitment that allowed the building of an incredible family and extended family unit that is the envy of most. The road bumps of the journey are just a simple reminder to not take for granted to work harder towards the never-ending journey of life.
 
### My Mother
Decided to send me to "English Technical" school in Singapore. The ability to read, write and converse in English allowed me to learn and explore the world after the end of the 2nd World War in 1945. Allowed me to succeed and thrive in a "technical school" environment as opposed to an "academic" one. A solid backbone I was able to base my future on.
 
Trusted my judgement and providing me the freedom to independently explore my world as I developed from a boy to a man. To be a self learner.
 
Supported my decision to travel overseas for my further education in Australia and in the process open up a whole new world.
 
### My Children & Grandchildren
Showed me that provided with the right environment the human spirit and limits have no bounds. Makes what is impossible possible. All that is required is space to grow and lots and lots of love.
 
### My Siblings
Allowed me to appreciate that diversity in character and values are to be valued as we develop and learn from our personal experiences. We are all individuals striving to do our very best whatever that might be.
 
### My Teachers (Technical)
The technical teachers who taught me and encouraged me to explore and discover my aptitude in non traditional subjects allowed me to excel at a level I could not have imagined.
 
### My Bosses/Managers
1. Mr Russell Elliott: My immediate managers who had the faith and trust in me and my ability to lead by inviting me to be a member of the Vice-President Administration's Management Team. Russell recognised that at that time the IT Services Division was regarded as being one of the most progressive and effective by its peers in Australia. A high point was the sale of administrative software to a world leading commercial software house.
 
2. Mr Barrie Hesketh: Barry recruited me to join him in setting up the Deakin Computer Centre when Deakin University was formed in 1977. Barrie assisted in the development of my leadership aspirations by giving me opportunities to be in the operational second-in-charge role. Deakin University was a great institution to work for and even today is viewed as one of the most progressive in the world. I am indeed fortunate to have spent 29 years of my working life at the University.
