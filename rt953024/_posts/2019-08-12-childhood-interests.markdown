**Television Programs**

It should be noted that as a child growing up in Singapore in 1957 (10 years old) the only access to English language radio was the Rediffusion cable radio service. The environment was one where the primary spoken language of adults in the household was "Chinese‚Äù particularly speaking in the "Hokkien" dialect. Programs were also broadcast in the English language.

Television was introduced to Singapore in 1963 (I was 16 yrs old at that time). Initially programs were about current affairs, such as daily news. 

Some of the English programs that we watched were:
* Perry Mason (1963)
* The Saint (1963)
* Mr Ed (1963)
* Man from UNCLE (1964)
* Columbo (1968)

**Radio Programs**

We listened to 
* Clitheroe Kid (Comedy via BBC International Service in 1957)
* British Hit Parade
* Kasey Kasem's American Top 40
* BBC's Beyond Our Ken (Comedy 1963)

Pop Vocal Performers
* Marty Robbins's El Paso (1959)
* Cliff Richard (1960)
* The Shadows (1960)
* The Everly Brothers (1960)
* The Blue Diamonds (1960)
* Elvis Presley
* The Crescendos (1961)
* The Beatles (1964
* Frankie Lane (1964)

**Books**

Unfortunately my misspent childhood will not allow me to recall more than the following:
* Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes
* Ian Fleming's James Bond series
I have no re-call of any favourite children's stories.
