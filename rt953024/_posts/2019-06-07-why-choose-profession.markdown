I happened to be sent to one of two secondary Technical Schools in Singapore. These schools, in addition to the normal secondary curriculum, included studies in Woodwork, Geometrical Drawing and Building Drawing. I found the special subjects to be challenging and a lot of fun especially where there was not a lot of need to "study" in the traditional way and I happened to excel in them without any need to put in a lot of effort. It was the obvious next step to take up the role of teaching, initially to Secondary School students and then the training of Craft Teachers in Singapore in 1968.

I arrived in Australia in 1970 to pursue Industrial Design at the Gordon Institute of Technology in Geelong. I changed my course of study at The Gordon to Information Processing. I graduated with a Bachelor of Applied Science (Information Processing) in 1973.

I worked for IBM as a Systems Engineer and then went onto Deakin University when it  opened. I worked at Deakin University from 1977 until I retired as Head of IT in 2006.

So, my choice of profession was very fortuitous in that I was around in the right place and at the right time. IT was a developing discipline with great opportunities for the early adopters. I usually say to those I meet that "it was great to be paid to indulge in your hobby". I guess my profession fell into my lap. I'm very very lucky and I know it too.
