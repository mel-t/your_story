I have changed my mind about Geelong. When I first set eyes on Geelong in 1970, my first impression was that it was a dump. It looked old and tired and the laws in regard to business hours and the limitations on what can be sold on a particular day and the total absence of "fast food" outlets was fairly challenging.
 
With the years that have passed and the inevitable changes that have transpired, I have grown to appreciate the city of Geelong and the environs (Bellarine Peninsula) a lot more that I thought I would.
 
Today I believe Geelong to be one of the best places I know to raise a family and I am glad we did.
 
Taken from another perspective I am very inflexible. My self belief in my own values are generally non negotiable.
