We were leading a happily married life of a middle aged couple in 1980 some 9 years after we were married. We were free wheeling and enjoying the life of a couple when Florence asked me if we should start a family. My response was that I didn't feel strongly about having children. In other words happy with either. Florence asked if I would be committed to having a family. My response was I will give 100% support for our children if we have them. Florence was not quite convinced with my response. 

This lead to the issue of how many we should have. The response was that we must have 2 or at least 2. The reason for this is that we have no close relatives in Australia and that our children deserve to have siblings to grow up together, be friends with and support one another.
