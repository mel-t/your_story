There was not much family tradition while I was growing up in Singapore. Being the second eldest and first boy in the family, I had the benefit of having dining treats with my father and mother on weekends. On occasions, there was a simple birthday celebration.
In Australia (from 1970 onwards), I had the benefit of creating new traditions in Australia, around birthdays, Chinese New Year, Christmas Eve and Christmas Day and birthdays of grandchildren.
