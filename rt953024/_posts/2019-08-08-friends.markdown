I have kept in touch with a Craft Teacher that I had trained. Christopher Ho taught for a few years and then decided to change his future in Hong Kong. He rose to the position of CEO of an insurance group and then returned to Singapore and worked in corporate insurance before retiring some 5 years ago. I have kept touch with Christopher on each of my visits.

My closest Singapore friend is Tng Hia-Seng. We were classmates since we commenced our secondary education. He was a technical teacher who went on to be the principal of a Singapore Technical school before he retired. I have visited or contacted Tng on my previous visits to Singapore as well.

In Australia I have kept in touch with a handful of friends who came from South East Asian backgrounds and have maintained some life long friendships with a few of them. Some that come to mind are:

University Friends:
* Francis Foo (best man) and Wai-Jean Chan (bridesmaid)
* Corey Khor & Alice 
* Lim Leong-Kee

Geelong Friends:
* Dr Michael Lim, Audrey and Adeline Lim

There are others who are friends by virtue of the fact that we are members of social or sporting organisations.
