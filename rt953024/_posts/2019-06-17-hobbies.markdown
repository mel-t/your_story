My favourite hobbies are:

* Music - both classical and popular music, especially the "country rock" genre. I picked this up around 1960 while I was growing up in Singapore. This was initially from the Rediffusion wire radio service. This then led to the Kasey Kasem American Top 40 program and UK Singles chart. I dabbled with playing the guitar and singing.

* Golf - I watched TV programs of golf in Australia in 1970 and was hooked. I've enjoyed golf as an individual sport. I had a hit of a golf ball at Queens Park public golf course in Geelong in 1972 and have been a member of a few Golf CLubs since then.
