**Where I grew up**

In Singapore I lived the first 10 years of my life at the top floor of a terrace house. The ground floor was a grocery store. There was not much space available for sporting or recreational activities.

I then lived on the second floor of a flat adjacent to a missionary school for the next 2 years.  

This was followed by 5 years in a residential bungalow adjacent to the sea. The environment was extremely relaxed and serene.

My last 6 years in Singapore was in a residential 2-storey terrace house overlooking the sea.

Generally the neighborhood I grew up in can best be described as typical mixed commercial and residential with not much space for recreational activities.
