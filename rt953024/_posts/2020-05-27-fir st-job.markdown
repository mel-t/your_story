My first job was that of a Technical Teacher in Singapore where I taught Woodwork, Geometrical, Engineering & Building drawing. It was a natural progression for me as I was a student of Technical school. I had a lot of fun working with year 9 & year 10 students. I was then headhunted to train a group of Craft teachers for Singapore's educational institutions. I left my job in Singapore to further my study in the area of Industrial Design at the Gordon Institute of Technology in Geelong Australia.
