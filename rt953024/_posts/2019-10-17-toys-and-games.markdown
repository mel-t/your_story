I love and was fascinated by vehicles like cars and trucks. These came in 2 forms:

1. Metal pressed forms of road vehicles or airplanes that come with a rotating wheel to propel the vehicle. I usually opened it up, dismantling it to see how the internals work.

2. Vehicles that are cast in soft metal like the Match Box series. I then created my own road system by drawing on a large board roads, service stations, parking lots, etc. I then spent hours playing on the board enacting simple stories like, driving from home to town, to shopping centres, etc.
