As a child I was closer to my mother because my father was never around. 
 
Some of the factors that contributed to this situation were:
* I didnâ€™t see much of my father. He was usually off-site (from our business premises during the working hours and the working hours are long, i.e. more than 9 to 10 hours).
* He did not talk or directly interact with his children at the time.
* My father was perceived to be loud and unfriendly
There was no opportunity for any relationship to be developed and fostered.
* As an adult, my relationship with my father was somewhat improved. We conversed politely but not with a great deal of warmth. Again, this reflects the cultural norm of the time. 
 
In summary the above outcome is understandable given that my parents and I lived in separate houses since I was 12 years old.
