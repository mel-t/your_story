[My Parents](#my-parents)

[What I Disagreed With](#what-i-disagreed-with)

### My Parents

As a child I was closer to my mother because my father was never around. 
 
Some of the factors that contributed to this situation were:
* I didnâ€™t see much of my father. He was usually off-site (from our business premises during the working hours and the working hours are long, i.e. more than 9 to 10 hours).
* He did not talk or directly interact with his children at the time.
* My father was perceived to be loud and unfriendly
There was no opportunity for any relationship to be developed and fostered.
* As an adult, my relationship with my father was somewhat improved. We conversed politely but not with a great deal of warmth. Again, this reflects the cultural norm of the time. 
 
In summary the above outcome is understandable given that my parents and I lived in separate houses since I was 12 years old. 

### What I Disagreed With 

I disagreed with my father's understanding of his responsibilities to his children. He believes in the old fashioned "Chinese" mindset that all that is required of him is to provide his family with shelter, clothing and food.
The concept of the expression of care and love within the family is foreign to him.
He seems to think that so long as there is a house to live in, his responsibility only extends to ensure that "no one is hungry, cold or wet."
