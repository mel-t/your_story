My favorite holiday was a 4 week tour of USA/Britain/Europe/Singapore in 1991 with my daughter. It was memorable for the following reasons:
* 1st tour of the USA, Britain, Europe and I was able to experience first hand what it feels like to see the countries, cities and landmarks that I had only read and seen in history lessons while in school.
* The added bonus was the sharing of this experience with my eldest daughter
