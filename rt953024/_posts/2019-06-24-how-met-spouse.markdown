Florence and I have known each other since we were in Primary 4 of Seraya Primary School in Singapore. We lost touch after completing our primary education, each attending a different Secondary School that is adjacent to one another.
 
One day I caught a glimpse of Florence after school was over and noted the address of where she was living. I was smitten. I then sent her a letter saying that I would like to have a date with her by going to the movies.
 
We arranged to meet and I was surprised to see that Florence had brought a friend with her. Florence's excuse for bringing a friend or "chaperone" was explained by saying that the friend she had brought along expressed that she liked me. We went to the movie as a threesome.
 
We have been together since.
