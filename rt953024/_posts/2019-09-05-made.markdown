I was a Technical Teacher in Singapore in 1968 and had access to the facilities of a woodworking workshop.

I designed and built a Hi-Fi Stereo Sound system. It consisted of an ensemble of 4 cabinets that were joined together and suspended by 5 rectangular frames. 

This ensemble was completely made of "teak" wood stained with teak oil to enhance the natural matte finish.

The 4 cabinets were used to house the following:
1. Audio Amplifier
2. Vinyl Record Turntable
3. 12" Long Playing Vinyl Records with sliding louvre cover
4. Tandberg Reel-to-Reel Tape Recorder

The above configuration was then connected to 2 Whafedale speakers that were mounted vertically a third above the ground in a fibre-cement tube. The sound was then diffused by the placement of a hollow inverted metallic sphere on top of the 1.4 metre fibre cement tube.
