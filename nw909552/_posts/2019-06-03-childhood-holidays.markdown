I remember going on camping holidays with Mum, Dad, Shirley and Angela. We went around Wales and other parts of England. We would often go to the beach while on holiday. I remember going to Butlins holiday camp. I remember going on the ferry to Le Harve in France when we went camping around Europe. We had a great time travelling around.
 
We moved around quite a bit spending 2 years in each place and this often felt like being on holiday.
 
In Australia we went on holiday to Sydney and Canberra. We also went to Cairns where we stayed at Ellis Beach.
